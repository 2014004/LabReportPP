# Making lab report

## Steps

1. Create login on github.com
1. Verify email
1. Login to github.com
1. Visit [https://github.com/CoE-GNE/LabReportPP](https://github.com/CoE-GNE/LabReportPP)
1. Near top, in line of `CoE-GNE/LabReportPP`, on extreme right, look for three buttons, named `Watch`, `Star` and `Fork`.
1. Click on `Fork`.
1. If you need help on form, visit: [Help on forking](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
1. In following, replace `YourGitHubUserID` with your github userID.
1. In directory `public_html` of your account on `Code Server`, issue command: `git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUserID/LabReportPP.git`
1. Go to directory LabReportPP, by using command `cd LabReportPP`.
1. Using `xmake` create a new project, say `Ex01`.
1. Go to the newly created folder, by following command. Replace `Ex01`, if you used some different project name.
1. `cd Ex01`
1. Edit `src/main.c`
1. Create more .c or .h files as per the requirements of the project.
1. Compile with `xmake`
1. Remove errors / warnings, if you get any.
1. Execute code by `xmake run`
1. Test you code. When all is Ok, then to generate lab report for this practical, issue command: `labrep`
1. It will produce `report.md` and `report.html` file in current folder.
1. Edit `report.md` file, to add more content, or to change anything.
1. To update `report.html` from this amended `report.md` file, issue command: `md2html report`
1. Go to parent folder by `cd ..`
1. Edit `lab.md` file.
1. Issue command: `md2html lab`

### Writing a Programming Lab Report

## Report Format

### Assignment/Problem Description: What were you required to implement?

This is a word-for-word reiteration of the problem given to you.

### Discussion:

1. Solution/Program Description:

  A brief description of what your program does, including how your program works. For example, you might state whether your solution is recursive or iterative. If required or requested, include a flowchart that corresponds to the design of your program.
2. Major Implementation Issues:

  What were the most difficult parts of your program to implement?

### Known Bugs and/or Errors:

List all the known limitations / bugs and / or errors of your program.

After extensively testing your program, you should be aware of (nearly) every issue it has. How does your program handle bad input? How does your program handle edge cases? This section is a space for full-disclosure; what's wrong with your program?

### Lessons Learned:

1. What went well
2. What you would do differently next time
3. How the exercise might be revised to make it clearer/more satisfying
4. What the faculty members might have done differently to promote learning

### General Tips

1. It is expected that you use as much simple language as you can. There should be no emphasis placed on "expressing yourself" or "keeping it interesting"; a programming lab report is not a narrative.
1. In a lab report, it is important to get to the point. Be descriptive enough that your audience can understand the problem and your solution, but strive to be concise.
1. Focus on the work accomplished
1. Do document well the process used to complete the work.

## To know about how to make good webpages, it is recommended to go through the following.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CoE-GNE/LabReportPP/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/CoE-GNE/LabReportPP/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://support.github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.
